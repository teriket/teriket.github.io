            <p class="fs-5">Completing my bachelor's degree in computer science has grown my technical skills and prepared me
                for professional work in several ways.  On the technical side, my education in data structures and algorithms 
                has led me to think critically about the time and memory complexity of my designs. The program has also instilled
                an appreciation for my role in an Agile team.  As a software engineer, I can bridge the gap between people and technology,
                which is especially important because computers are inaccessible to many people.  As such, communicating with stakeholders
                is important in ensuring my designs are accessible and properly fit the clients needs.  For example, in my UI/ UX
                class, performing client interviews uncovered user needs that I hadn't originally anticipated.  My software security
                coursework has given me a critical eye for exploitable code and trustworthy data.  Finally, my coursework in databases
                and software engineering has empowered me to design efficient and scalable solutions that connect users to data.</p>
            <p class="fs-5">
                This portfolio piece demonstrates my technical skills in software design and engineering, algorithms and datastructures,
                 and databases across two separate artifact enhancements.  Between these artifact enhancements, I aim to demonstrate competency 
                 across all five of Southern New Hampshire Universities objectives for computer science students:</p>

            <p class="fs-5">  The artifact 
                 attached to this article is a game engine that has been redesigned from SNHU's CS330: Computer Graphics and 
                 Visualization.  The enhancement aims to rebuild the solution into a functioning game engine.  In doing so, I am
                demonstrating my ability to design software systems based on a project specification and balance the tradeoffs between
                data structures and algorithms that solve a given problem.  The other artifact, a refactorization of code from SNHU's
                CS465: Full Stack Web Development, aims to showcase my ability to work with a database to solve a given problem.  This
                artifact can be found in the "Data Science" page of this website. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="fw-bold">Project Narrative</h2>
            <h3 class="text-start fw-bold fst-italic">Introduction to the artifact</h3>
            <p class="fs-5">This artifact comes from SNHU’s CS330 Computational Graphics and Visualization course.  
                The original code was a Phong renderer of a scene built from primitive geometry.  The updated design 
                has the overarching goal of becoming a game engine that supports multiplayer, user-generated content.  
                While this is a long-term project, the renderer has been rebuilt from the ground up through these enhancements
                to support an entity component system and mesh rendering.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-5">I have several reasons for including this project in my ePortfolio.  As a long-term project, I can 
                continuously showcase progress on code that is interactive, useful, and produces visually appealing outputs in my
                ePortfolio.  I was also disappointed with the engineering aspects of the computational graphics and visualization class.  
                The class had prebuilt code that emphasized students manipulating variables to pass to shaders – which students didn’t write. 
                I saw – and wanted to create – improvements to the design and functionality of that code.  I also really enjoy
                computational graphics, game engine design, and game programming as subjects.  I would have a fulfilling career in those fields.</p>

            <p class="fs-5">
                From a data structures and algorithms perspective, this project was included to showcase fundamental skills in data management.  The
                tree structure game objects are stored in showcases pointer management and using searching algorithms, like breadth-first search.
                Several classes, like the Renderer and MeshManager use vectors as queues.  Rendering also requires moving large
                amounts of data from the CPU to the GPU.  This code showcases using openGL to efficiently pack and ship
                data to be processed using structs.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-start fw-bold fst-italic">Enhancements Completed</h3>
            <p class="fs-5">
                <ul>
                    <li class="fs-5">The entire code base was rewritten to support an ECS</li>
                    <li class="fs-5">Gameobjects are now stored in a tree structure</li>

            </p>

            <h3 class="text-start fw-bold fst-italic">Reflection</h3>
            <p class="fs-5">	I overcame, and learned from, both technical and design challenges.  On the technical side, 
                I had to learn about importing and managing libraries, and compiling for different CPU architectures (like x86, 64-bit, Win32).  
                On the design side, I hadn’t fully considered the multiplicity of some relationships.  This interfered with the algorithms I chose
                to use.  I also found some objects had dependencies from other objects I hadn’t anticipated.  Fortunately, 
                I found these challenges in the early prototyping stage of coding, so it was easy
                 to update the designs.  I also didn't have a lot of experience using OpenGL and its supporting libraries.  To write the 
                rendering algorithm, I had to learn fundamental concepts – like using VBO’s, VAO’s, and EBO’s as efficient 
                busses of data from the CPU to the GPU.  One challenge I faced was that the resources I was learning from used 
                different strategies and architectures to build their mesh renderer.  I had to understand their code and why it worked,
                 then figure out how to write code form-fitted to my systems architecture.</p>

            <h3 class="text-start fw-bold fst-italic">Skills Demonstrated</h3>
            <p class="fs-5"><ul>
                <li class="fs-5">Using industry standard libraries, like OpenGL</li>
                <li class="fs-5">Designing code with scalability and modularity in mind</li>
                <li class="fs-5">Using industry standard design patterns</li>
                <li class="fs-5">Balancing tradeoffs between algorithmic complexity and design decisions</li>

            </ul></p>

            <h3 class="text-start fw-bold fst-italic">Course Outcomes Demonstrated</h3>
            <p class="fs-5 fst-italic">1. "Employ strategies for building collaborative
                environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer
                science"</p>
            <p class="fs-5">The previous iteration of this code was based on two monolithic
                classes that added objects to a scene, handled user inputs, camera movements, and rendering.  This design was inaccessible
                to anyone other than a computer scientist.  In building out this API, arists, designers, users, and other engineers are better 
                able to interact with the code.  This is done by creating modular code that is easier for other engineers to interact with.  Both
                standard design patterns and in-line comments support this. When a user interface
                is applied on top of this API, other stakeholders won't have to worry about the technical details of the project, 
                effectively bridging the gap between people and technology.

            <p class="fs-5">A lot of the communications developed for this project are designed
                for a technical audience.  It includes UML documents to describe the functionality of the code, and in-line code comments
                to help other developers better understand the design intentions of the code.

            <p class="fs-5">This code uses a tree structure to manage objects and their components.
                The tree structure is more a convienience to users in managing their creations because balancing a tree would be destructive
                to their workflow.  A benefit of this structure though is that the computational complexity of inserting and deleting objects
                is O(1).  Searching for objects has a worst-case time complexity of O(n) because this tree must search through every element
                to find an object.  Components on game objects are stored in vectors.  While this would mean that insertion, searches, and deletion
                of components on a game object would have an O(n) time complexity, game objects are expected to have few components attached to them.
                Functionally, this means they have an O(1) time complexity.

                The efficiency of the rendering algorithm could be improved via caching.  Currently, the engine searches through all Gameobjects
                in a scene every frame, looking for something to render.  The engine could cache meshes, lights, textures, and materials, then render
                from the cache.  Because items may be created or destroyed during runtime, the API would need to be update the cache.

            <p class="fs-5 fst-italic">4. "Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and
                        innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions
                        that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals"</p>
            <p class="fs-5">There are several design patterns within the desing space of game
                engines that makes code reusable, extensible, and efficient.  This code uses an entity component system, which makes reusing code
                between objects easier, and enables objects to easily communicate with eachother via Liskov substitution.  Another pattern present
                in this code is the use of singletons.  Singletons ensure that only a single instance of an object is shared between different objects.
                In the context of the game engine, this is performant because it allows objects to share resources rather than instantiating 
                redundant ones.  Because the engine needs to "run" at least 60 times a second, reducing resource usage is paramount to creating
                a performant rendering engine.  One way this could be improved is by adding unit tests to the game engine.

            <p class="fs-5  fst-italic">5. "Develop a security mindset that anticipates 
                        adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, 
                        mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources"</p>
            <p class="fs-5">This game engine is designed with user-generated multiplayer content in mind.
                As such, users are capable of creating scenes with deeply nested objects, then calling a recursive object search which
                could lead to stack overflow errors and game instability.  To prevent this, objects track how deep they are within the
                tree, and reject object creation if it is too deep.  Similarly, users could create massive scenes that hog server-side resources.
                While it is a goal that users should be able to build their vision, it is also expected that the game is stable and performant.
                As such, scenes track and limit their sizes.

            <h3 class="text-start fw-bold fst-italic">The Future</h3>
            <p class="fs-5">The work demonstrated in this article is merely early API development, and a front-facing video game does not live solely
                on an API.  Future development should be focused on building an interface that users can build levels with.  This includes UI/UX components
                to add models to a scene, a visual scripting language to add functionality to user creations, playable characters, and a server to host games on.
                Additionally, the API also requires an added physics and sound systems -- which would likely mean importing additional libraries.  More rendering
                features and shaders could also be added to the code to enhance the look of the game.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5">From a software fundamentals perspective, this code could be enhanced in several ways.  Many objects currently use pointers over unique_ptr or 
                shared_ptr, which puts the system at risk for memory leaks.  The use of singleton objects is also inconsistent between manager classes.
                The current design is also inflexible when it comes to using shaders.  While I am happy with the modularization of most of this code,
                the rendering, materials, shader, and texture code should be teased apart further to make future development easier.  Finally, there still exists
                code provided by SNHU and learnopengl.com in this code base, which should be refactored for originality for the sake of copyright law.
